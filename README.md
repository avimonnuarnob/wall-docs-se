    1. Code behaves as it was expected. Although there was some typos and here and there and small fixes on business logic. 
    2. Naming convention is not consistent. Code used both camelCase and snake_case. variable names also can be refactored into something more clear.
    3. The comments are way too clear for my experice. I actually loved it. In some cases comments might seem overwhelming though as it also included some test cases with it.


## Bonus points
    1. Simply changing the logic into checking if a tap is being used for the first time or not cut down the additional time.
    2. Simply put the amount of time it would take to fill up all the bottles is directly disproportionate to the rate of water each tape produces. so bringing up the rate of water a tape produces will cause less time in theory.
